Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network Protocol is a decentralized messaging protocol that allows users to communicate and collaborate across multiple platforms and devices. Its features include real-time messaging, encryption, server federation, and openness. We will rename it to REChain Basis and take a look at its structure and operating principles.

REChain Basis Basic Principles
REChain Basis is a protocol for creating decentralized and secure communication networks that enable instant messaging, video calling, file sharing, and other forms of digital interaction.

1. Federation
REChain Basis operates on the principle of federation, meaning that the system consists of independent servers (or nodes) that can communicate with each other. These servers may belong to different organizations or individuals, but they all follow the same set of standards, allowing them to exchange data.

| Server A |<------>| Server B |
| (User's chat) | | (User's chat) |
+------------------+ +------------------+
| |
+-------------------+ +-------------------+
| Server C |<------>| Server D |
|(Group messages) | | (Group messages) |
+-------------------+ +-------------------+
2. Decentralized Messaging
REChain Basis allows messaging between users registered on different servers. This means that messages can be delivered from one server to another, even if they belong to different organizations or users.

+------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+
| |
+------------------+ +------------------+
| Server 2 |<-----| Server 3 |
| (Processing requests)| | (Processing requests)|
+------------------+ +------------------+
3. End-to-end encryption
One of the key features of REChain Basis is its support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This ensures that only the sender and receiver can read messages. Even if the servers through which messages pass are hacked, attackers will not be able to access the contents of the messages.

| User 1 | ---> | Server 1 | ---> | User 2 |
| (Encrypts data) | | (Transmits encrypted data) | (Decrypts data) |
+------------------+ +--------------------+ +------------------+
4. Data Synchronization and Storage
Each server in the REChain Basis network synchronizes its data with other servers via open APIs. This allows users on different servers to see shared chats and messages, even if they are registered on different platforms.

+--------------------+ +--------------------+ +--------------------+
5. Modular Architecture
The REChain Basis protocol has a modular architecture, which allows adding new features such as video calls, file sharing, user management, etc. Each of these modules can be deployed or configured separately without affecting the operation of other parts of the system.

Protocol and API
The REChain Basis protocol includes several components that enable interaction between different services and devices:

HTTP API for exchanging messages between servers.
WebSocket API for real-time messaging.
REST API for managing user accounts, connections, and other data.
Each of these APIs allows services to interact, send requests, and pass information across a federation of servers.

6. Interoperability
REChain Basis is designed to be compatible with other protocols and networks. This allows it to be integrated with existing messaging platforms and services, expanding its capabilities and providing greater flexibility.

REChain Basis Application Examples
Chat programs: REChain Basis can be used to create chat programs with high security and decentralization requirements, for example for organizations that want to ensure the privacy of their employees.

Group chats and conferences: With support for video calls and file sharing, REChain Basis is ideal for organizing remote workflows and group video conferences.

Internet of Things (IoT): REChain Basis can be used in IoT networks, where devices need to exchange data securely with each other and with the server.

Conclusion
REChain Basis is a powerful and flexible protocol for decentralized messaging that has many advantages, including a federated architecture, support for end-to-end encryption, and a modular structure. These features make it a great choice for building secure and private communication services that can operate in a variety of settings and scales.

For a lower-level explanation of the REChain Basis protocol (which is a rebranded variant of the Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network Protocol), we will dive into the details of how it works ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù. This will include its core components, messaging mechanisms, and the internal processes that enable decentralized and secure communication.

1. The Main Components of the REChain Basis System
The REChain Basis protocol consists of several key elements:

Servers (or Nodes): Each server in the REChain Basis network is a standalone application that manages user data, processes requests, and synchronizes information with other servers. Servers can be public or private, and can exchange data through API protocols.
Clients: User applications that interact with servers. Clients can be web or mobile applications, or they can be implemented as standalone libraries for integration with other services.
Messaging Protocol: Messages are exchanged between clients and servers using a specific protocol that governs data formats, requests and responses, and message synchronization.
Federation: Servers communicate through a federated network, allowing independent servers to exchange data.
2. Data Formats and Message Syntax
a. JSON Message Format
The REChain Basis protocol uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as a format for data transfer. It is a simple and convenient structure for data serialization, which is widely used in REST and HTTP APIs.

An example of a JSON message in the REChain Basis protocol might look like this:

{
"event_type": "m.room.message",
"sender": "@alice:example.com",
"content": {
"msgtype": "m.text",
"body": "Hello, world!"
},
"room_id": "!room1234:example.com"
}
Here:

"event_type" specifies the type of event (in this case, a chat message).
"sender" is the sender's ID.
"content" contains the message content (text).
"room_id" is a unique identifier for the room in which the messages are exchanged.
b. Message and room IDs
Each message in the network has a unique ID, which allows servers and clients to accurately identify when and who sent a particular message. IDs can be represented as strings, for example, !room1234:example.com.

Each room (group chat or channel) also has a unique ID, which allows users and servers to synchronize messages and events between different participants.

3. Messaging Algorithms and Synchronization
Messaging between clients and servers is done according to a predefined algorithm. Here's how it works:

a. Publishing and delivering messages
When a user sends a message through a client, the client goes through several steps:

Client creates a request: The client creates a JSON message, which is a text message.
Send to server: The client sends a request to the server via HTTP or WebSocket API. This request is usually sent in POST format with the message data.
Server processes the request: The server accepts the request, stores it in its database, performs any necessary checks (for example, encryption), and then sends it to other users in the room (if it is a group message).
Delivery to other users: The message is synchronized and distributed to all other participants in the room via federation. Other servers can process this message, deliver it to the user, and synchronize it with their local message database.
b. Synchronization Mechanism
Servers in the REChain Basis network must support synchronization of messages between waiting for themselves. To do this, they use backfill and re-sync mechanisms.

Backfill: When a new server or client joins a room, it can request old messages that were sent before it joined. Servers in the federation pass these messages along so that the client can fully reconstruct the chat history.
Re-sync: This mechanism is used when the data on the server has become incomplete or corrupted. The server initiates a request to re-synchronize the data with other servers.
4. End-to-end encryption
One of the most important aspects of the security of the REChain Basis protocol is end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This means that all data transmitted between users is encrypted in such a way that only the sender and receiver can decrypt it.

a. Encryption algorithm
REChain Basis uses Megolm, a cryptographic algorithm for group chats based on symmetric encryption. For each message, a unique key is generated and the message is encrypted using this key.

Key Generation: Each group member generates a public/private key pair. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
Message Encryption: Messages sent to the room are encrypted on the client before being sent to the server. Only those members who have the corresponding private key can decrypt the message.
Message Decryption: When a message arrives on the client, it is decrypted locally, not on the server.
b. Key Exchange Process
In order to successfully decrypt messages, the members of the room must exchange encryption keys. When a new user joins the group, they must receive keys to decrypt old messages (using the key exchange mechanism).

5. Federation Process and Server Interaction
The federation process is how REChain Basis servers exchange messages with each other. Each server maintains its own local database and synchronizes changes with other servers.

Requests and Responses: When one server receives a request from another server, it sends a corresponding response via HTTP API. These requests can include data about users, chats, and messages.
Message Publishing: When a server receives a message from a client, it not only stores it in its database, but also sends it to all other servers in the federation that serve the participants of the same room.
Partial Synchronization: When a server does not have a complete set of data for a particular room, it can request the missing messages from other servers in the federation.
Conclusion
REChain Basis is a powerful and flexible decentralized messaging protocol with a deep focus on security and privacy. Its core principles, such as federation, encryption, and message synchronization, make it suitable for building secure and scalable communication platforms.

In this low-level analysis, we have covered the key components and mechanisms of the REChain Basis protocol, including data handling, messaging algorithms, and security methods that make this protocol unique.

6. Clients for REChain Basis
There are several client applications for working with the REChain Basis protocol (renamed from Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network Protocol) that provide user interaction with the server, messaging, and other functions. Two such clients, developed by the author on GitHub, are REChain and Katya. Let's take a closer look at how these clients interact with the protocol and what they do at a low level.

a. REChain Client
REChain is a client for the REChain Basis protocol that provides basic communication functions such as sending and receiving messages, working with groups, and supporting server federation. The client implements work with REST API, WebSocket API and other low-level interaction mechanisms.

The REChain repository is available at the following address:
REChain GitHub repository

The main features of REChain:

Connection to the server: The client connects to the server via API, using REST or WebSocket to ensure synchronous work with the server and receive messages in real time.
Authorization: The client handles the process of registration and authorization of users using security tokens. This is an important component for implementing security and protecting user data.
Message processing: REChain implements sending and receiving messages in JSON format, supports text and multimedia messages. The client can support both private chats and group chats.
Server federation: Interaction with other federation servers is carried out via API. This mechanism supports data synchronization between the server and the client.
Message encryption: REChain implements basic data encryption on client side, which ensures the privacy of messages.
At the implementation level, the client uses the core components of the REChain Basis protocol to exchange messages and process requests. An example of interaction with the API to send a message might be as follows:

import requests

url = 'https://example.com/_Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network Protocol/client/r0/rooms/!roomid:example.com/send/m.room.message'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer <access_token>'}
data = {
"msgtype": "m.text",
"body": "Hello, world!"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)
Here:

The client sends a POST request to the server with a message.
The server processes the request, records the message, and synchronizes it with other users in the room.
b. Katya Client
Katya is another client for the REChain Basis protocol that is designed to be used in various platforms such as mobile devices and web applications. Katya provides additional features such as video calling support, file sharing, and improved UI rendering.

The Katya repository is available at the following address:
Katya GitHub repository

The main features of Katya:

Multimedia messaging support: Katya is not limited to text messages. It supports sending and receiving media files such as images, videos, and audio files.
Video calls and voice messages: Katya can handle video calls, implementing P2P connections between users. Interaction with video streams is managed via WebRTC.
Interface with improved visualization: Katya client is designed with an emphasis on user convenience, with a modern interface for messaging and room management.
Integration with other services: Katya supports integration with various third-party services to expand functionality, such as cloud storage for file sharing.
Interaction with the REChain Basis protocol in Katya is carried out via the same APIs (REST, WebSocket, etc.), but with more complex processing of media data and interface solutions. An example of code for sending messages and receiving responses in Katya might look like this:

import websocket
import json

# WebSocket connection to the server
def on_message(ws, message):
print(f"Received message: {message}")

def on_error(ws, error):
print(f"Error: {error}")

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
print("Closed connection")

def on_open(ws):
message = {
"msgtype": "m.text",
"body": "Hello from Katya!"
}
ws.send(json.dumps(message))

# Establishing a WebSocket connection
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
"wss://example.com/_Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network Protocol/client/r0/rooms/!roomid:example.com/messages",
on_message=on_message,
on_error=on_error,
on_close=on_close
)
ws.on_open = on_open
ws.run_forever()
Here:

Katya uses WebSocket to exchange messages in real time.
When the connection is established, Katya sends a text message to the room.
All messages are received and processed in the on_message function.
c. Common Features of REChain and Katya Clients
Both REChain and Katya use similar principles of operation, but with different levels of functionality and user interface:

Messaging: Both clients process messages via REST or WebSocket API.
Encryption: Messages in both clients are encrypted on the client side to ensure privacy.
Group Chat and Video Call Support: Katya supports more advanced features such as video calls, while REChain focuses on basic text messaging and group chats.
Server Federation: Both clients can communicate with multiple servers, allowing users to communicate across different platforms.
Conclusion
REChain and Katya clients support the REChain Basis protocol, allowing users to send messages, share media, support video calls, and integrate additional features. Both clients use common principles such as server federation and encryption, but Katya provides more advanced features including multimedia messaging and an improved user interface.

These clients are good examples of how REChain Basis can be effectively used to build scalable and secure communication applications.

Let's dive into a detailed description of the federation structure, messaging, and offline operation of the REChain Basis protocol (renamed from Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network Protocol), and, for clarity, add diagrams to help visualize these processes.

1. Federation Structure in REChain Basis
Federation in the Context of REChain n Basis means that multiple servers (or nodes) can communicate with each other, exchange messages and synchronize data, but each server remains autonomous and can be managed separately. This allows for a distributed network where each participant can choose the server on which to store their data, but still participate in common chats with users of other servers.

Diagram 1: Federation Structure

+------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+
| Server A |<------>| Server B |<------>| Server C |
| (User's chat) | | (User's chat) | | (User's chat) |
+------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+
| | |
+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+
| Server D |<---->| Server E |<---->| Server F |
| (Group chat) | | (Group chat) | | (Group chat) |
+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+
| | |
+------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
| Server G |<----------->| Server H |<------------>| Server I |
|(Private messages)| | (Private messages)| | (Private messages)|
+------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
In this diagram:

Each server (A, B, C, etc.) manages individual users and stores their data.
Servers can join together to form group chats or sync messages between themselves.
Servers can communicate with any other server, even if they are located in different parts of the network.
Each server has a local database that is synchronized with other servers to ensure that messages and data are up-to-date.
This way, even if one server in the network goes down, the other servers will continue to function, maintaining the independence and stability of the system.

2. Messaging through Federation
In the REChain Basis federated network, messaging is done through multiple servers. When a user sends a message, it passes through multiple servers and is routed to the recipient, even if the recipient is registered on a different server.

Diagram 2: Messaging in a Federation

+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+
| Client 1 | -----> | Server 1 | -----> | Server 2 |
| (Sending) | |(Processing a request)| |(Routing messages)|
+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+
|
+-------------------+
| Server 3 |
| (Processing the message) |
+-------------------+
|
+-------------------+
| Client 2 |
| (Recipient) |
+-------------------+
Sending a message:

Client 1 creates and sends a message (e.g. text) via the API to its local server (Server 1).
Routing through servers:

Server 1 receives the request and decides that the message should be delivered to other servers (e.g. via an HTTP request or WebSocket).
The message is forwarded through federation servers (e.g. via Server 2 and Server 3), which can be in different parts of the world.
Delivery to the end client:

Server 3, having received the message, delivers it to Client 2, which is located on a different server.
Synchronization and processing:

The servers synchronize their databases so that all users in the room receive up-to-date information.

In this way, each message is transmitted through several servers until it reaches the recipient.

3. Offline Operation Without Internet
Although the REChain Basis protocol is designed to work over the Internet, it is possible to organize local autonomous operation of the network without connecting to the global network. In this case, servers and clients can exchange data within a local area network (LAN), using the same synchronization and routing mechanisms, but without the need to connect to external servers.

a. Local Federation
In an autonomous network, all servers can work without the Internet and synchronize with each other over a local network (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet). This can be useful in isolated environments (e.g., in an enterprise or in military applications).

Diagram 3: Autonomous Federation in a Local Area Network

+------

------------+
| Local Area Network |
| (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) |
+------------------+
|
+-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
| Server 1 |<->| Server 2 |<->| Server 3 |
| (Chats, Database) | | (Chats, Database) | | (Chats, Database) |
+-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
| | |
+--------------+ +--------------+ +-----------------+
| Client 1 | | Client 2 | | Client 3 |
| (Sending) | | (Receiving) | | (Receiving) |
+---------------+ +--------------+ +-----------------+
Here:

All servers are located in a local network, which allows data exchange without Internet access.
Clients can send and receive messages between themselves, synchronizing them through local servers.
Even if there is no Internet connection, the network continues to operate autonomously, ensuring communication between participants.
b. Messaging in a Local Network
If all devices are connected to one local network, messaging is carried out in the same way as in a global network, but without the need to send data over the Internet. This makes the system especially convenient for work in conditions of limited or no Internet.

Diagram 4: Messaging in a Local Network

+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+
| Client 1 | -----> | Server 1 | -----> | Server 2 |
| (Sending) | |(Request processing)| |(Message routing)|
+-------------------+ +-------------------+ +-------------------+
|
+-------------------+
| Server 3 |
| (Message processing) |
+-------------------+
|
+-------------------+
| Client 2 |
| (Recipient) |
+-------------------+
In this case:

All devices can work autonomously within the local network.
If there is no Internet, the servers will continue to route messages and synchronize data, but all operations occur only within the local network, without access to the global network.
4. Availability and Problems of Offline Operation
When the system works autonomously without the Internet, it is important to remember some limitations:

Message exchange with external users is impossible - if there is no connection to the global network, users will not be able to exchange messages with people outside the local network.
Resources are limited - since the system only works within a local network, the number of servers and clients is limited by the capabilities of this network.
Synchronization of data with other federations is not possible until an Internet connection is established.
However, for certain scenarios (e.g. disasters or closed enterprises), autonomous operation without the Internet can be very useful.

Conclusion
We have covered the basic principles of REChain Basis in the context of federation, messaging between servers and clients, and the ability to work autonomously without the Internet. All these elements make the protocol flexible and suitable for use in both global networks with an Internet connection and in isolated local networks, ensuring security, synchronization, and resilience of the system.
