### Welcome to the FIX Repository Wiki!
The **FIX Repository** is a terminal-based client designed to implement and interact with the **REChain Basis Protocol**, a decentralized communication and blockchain protocol. The client offers cross-platform compatibility, high security, and efficiency, leveraging Rust and Cargo for robust terminal-based functionality.

---

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- Terminal or shell environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows with PowerShell or WSL)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sorydima/FIX.git
   cd FIX
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

### Configuration
- The configuration file `config.toml` must include:
  ```toml
  [network]
  node_address = "127.0.0.1:8080"
  federation_mode = true

  [encryption]
  enable_e2e = true
  ```
- Adjust the settings to connect to your REChain Basis node or local server.

## Features
1. **Cross-Platform Support**  
   Run seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

2. **Real-Time Messaging**  
   Supports chat, group messaging, and federated communication between servers.

3. **End-to-End Encryption**  
   Secure communication with E2EE for maximum privacy.

4. **Decentralized Federation**  
   Connect to REChain Basis servers and interact with the broader network.

5. **Modular Design**  
   Expandable with additional modules for file sharing, video calls, and more.

## Architecture
### Protocol Overview
The FIX client implements core features of the **REChain Basis Protocol**, including:
- **Federation:** Servers exchange data securely and efficiently.
- **Messaging API:** REST and WebSocket interfaces for seamless communication.
- **Data Synchronization:** Supports backfill and re-sync for robust message delivery.

## Usage Guide
### Basic Commands
- **Login:**
  ```bash
  fix-cli login --username "user" --password "password"
  ```
- **Send Message:**
  ```bash
  fix-cli send --to "room_id" --message "Hello, REChain!"
  ```
- **Retrieve Messages:**
  ```bash
  fix-cli fetch --room "room_id"
  ```

### Advanced Configuration
- **Federation Mode:**
  Enable `federation_mode` in `config.toml` for decentralized communication.
- **Offline Mode:**
  Allows autonomous operation without an internet connection.
